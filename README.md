# MERN-Stack Infrastructure

Clone this repo for a future starter code for a future MERN-Stack project

## Here’s the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

Clone the mern-infrastructure repo:

 ### git clone "url of mern-infrastructure" "name-of-project"
👀 The folder created will be same as "name-of-project" instead of mern-infrastructure

### cd "name-of-project"

Install the Node modules:
### npm i

Create a .env (touch .env) and add entries for DATABASE_URL and SECRET

Update the "name": "mern-infrastructure" in package.json to the name of your project.

Build the React code to create the build folder, otherwise the Express server will not start up:
### npm run build

Create a new repo on your personal GH account.

Copy the new GH repo’s URL.

Update the remote’s URL:
### git remote set-url origin "paste the copied GH url"

Make the initial commit:
### git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"

Push for the first time:
### git push -u origin main

Remember that the Express server won’t start without error until the build folder used by Express is created by running:
npm run build

Have fun coding your new project and don’t forget to make frequent commits!
